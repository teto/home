// This configuration is merged with the default vicinae configuration file, which you can obtain by running the `vicinae config default` command.
// Every item defined in this file takes precedence over the values defined in the default config or any other imported file.
//
// You can make manual edits to this file, however you should keep in mind that this file may be written to by vicinae when a configuration change is made through the GUI.
// When that happens, any custom comments or formatting will be lost.
//
// If you want to maintain a configuration file with your own comments and formatting, you should create a separate file and add it to the 'imports' array.
//
// Learn more about configuration at https://docs.vicinae.com/config
