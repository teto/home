#[pair bob_contacts]
# A `[pair <name>]` block defines two storages `a` and `b` that should be
# synchronized. The definition of these storages follows in `[storage <name>]`
# blocks. This is similar to accounts in OfflineIMAP.
#a = bob_contacts_local
#b = bob_contacts_remote


# Synchronize all collections available on "side B" (in this case the server).
# You need to run `vdirsyncer discover` if new calendars/addressbooks are added
# on the server.

# Omitting this parameter implies that the given path and URL in the
# corresponding `[storage <name>]` blocks are already directly pointing to a
# collection each.

#collections = ["from b"]

# To resolve a conflict the following values are possible:
#   `null` - abort when collisions occur (default)
#   `"a wins"` - assume a's items to be more up-to-date
#   `"b wins"` - assume b's items to be more up-to-date

#[storage bob_contacts_local]
## A storage references actual data on a remote server or on the local disk.
## Similar to repositories in OfflineIMAP.
