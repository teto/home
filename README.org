* nixos install
I have fully switched to [[NixOS][www.nixos.org]], which means that some of the
software configuration files are generated by nix.


* Install on nixos via flakes

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# when not setting #my-machine, defaults to hostname
nixos-rebuild switch --flake '.#' --use-remote-sudo
#+END_SRC


* How to transfer state

Some secrets can't be shared reliably on the repository so they need to be
transferred.

** How to transfer secrets from another machine

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ nix shell nixpkgs#magic-wormhole
$ wormhole send ~/.gnupg ~/.password-store ~/.ssh
#+END_SRC

** How to recover the repo cyphered files

Get git-crypt do decypher the files
Retreive the key (possibly from an existing deployement via `gpg-crypt export-key`) and use
it on the new deployement via:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
$ git-crypt unlock <key>
#+END_SRC
should unlock the files.
