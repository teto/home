* how to access help
  manpage available via `npm help install`

* npm instlal: where are packages installed ?

  Without -g ("global") it installs in the $CWD/node_modules folder.
  -D => install as "dev-dependencies"
 
* why the `@` in the package ?
  it's a "scope": https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes

* test
  `npm i playwright`
npm list -g allows to list installed programs and their install folders, for instance:
~/.npm-global/lib
