* npm 

** how to access help
  manpage available via `npm help install`

  Without -g ("global") it installs in the $CWD/node_modules folder.
  -D => install as "dev-dependencies"
 
** why the `@` in the package ?
   it's a "scope": https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes

   #+begin_src shell
   npm i --lockfile-version=1
#+end_src

   `npm i playwright`
 npm list -g allows to list installed programs and their install folders, for instance:
 ~/.npm-global/lib

   npm ci
 

   ** How to map packages from package-lock.json to package.json
