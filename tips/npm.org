#+title: npm vs pnpm

* npm 

** how to access help
  manpage available via `npm help install`

** npm install: where are packages installed ?

  Without -g ("global") it installs in the $CWD/node_modules folder.
  -D => install as "dev-dependencies"
 
** why the `@` in the package ?
   it's a "scope": https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes
 
** to regenerate the package-lock.json with a specific version ?
 
   npm i --lockfile-version=1
 
** test
   `npm i playwright`
 npm list -g allows to list installed programs and their install folders, for instance:
 ~/.npm-global/lib
 
** How to install from lockfile
 
   npm ci
 
   
 
* pnpm


** install from lockfile

   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

pnpm link . (-g)

pnpm config
