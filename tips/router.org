* When booting, hit tab to edit the boot entry. Normally NixOS does not output to serial in the boot process, so we need to enable is by appending console=ttyS0,115200 to the boot entry. All characters appear twice, so just make sure you type it correctyl ;) . ctrl+l can be used to refresh the screen. * After installing, you want to make sure that the PCEngine APU entry from the NixOS hardware repo is present, as it enables the console port.
