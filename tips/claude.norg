  1. Sandbox Mode (Type this command):
  /sandbox
  This restricts write access to only your current directory and provides OS-level isolation.

  2. Deny All File Access (Most Restrictive):

  Edit ~/.claude/settings.json:
  {
    "permissions": {
      "deny": [
        "Read(**)",
        "Edit(**)",
        "Bash(**)"
      ]
    }
}
