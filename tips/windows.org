You gotta use NTFS to create the usb key else the install.wim gets corrupt

To create the USB key unetbootin is ok but it doesn't see NTFS drives so you have to pass the path when invoking the program like `sudo -E unetbootin installtype=USB targetdrive=/dev/sdd1`

Also to play some games, you need the media pack. You can install it from the "optional programs" panel.
