As easy as to compile the kernel:
You just need to write good options to your kernel config as done later on.

Tricky part is when you want to compile the kernel as a library to load it within ns3 DCE:
from the mptcp repository you add the net-next-sim repository as a remote even if it is on your filesystem.

$ git clone git@github.com:multipath-tcp/mptcp.git ~/mptcpoff
$ git clone git://github.com/thehajime/net-next-sim.git ~/net-next-sim


From the 'mptcpoff' local repository, checkout the branch you are interested in then:
$ git checkout mptcp_v0.89
$ git remote add nuse ~/net-next-sim
$ git fetch net-next-sim
$ git merge net-next-sim/sim3.14 --no-commit

=== How to choose the branches to merge
From the kernel source tree:
$ make kernelversion
For instance mptcp_v0.89 (with the kernel 3.14.33) should run ok with net-next-sim3.14 (3.14.0) (both can be merged, I tested it !).

=== create a proper config file ".config"

cat >> arch/sim/defconfig <<END

CONFIG_MPTCP_PM_ADVANCED=y
