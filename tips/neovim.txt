Note to my future self: to override my nix-installed telescope and use the checkout one, I had to:

set rtp^=~/telescope.nvim
lua require'plenary.reload'.reload_module('telescope')
lua require('telescope.builtin').vim_options{}


otherwise I ended up with a code that uses 2 different telescope apparently because of package.loaded
" to debug vimscript, use :mess to display error messages
" :scriptnames to list loaded scripts
" and prefix you command with 'verbose' is a very good way to get info
" like ':verbose map J' to know where it was loaded last

# treesitter
dump ast with
:lua print(vim.treesitter.get_parser(0):parse():root():sexpr())
