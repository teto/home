* Primer on postgresql

Interesting read about how it all fits together:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html

TLDR; tables live in a schema, unqualified commands are searched in search_path:
SHOW search_path;

One can modify it with:
SET search_path TO myschema,public;


pg_ctl start

POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION="$(pg_tmp)"
psql "$POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION" --no-psqlrc 

* Initialize a DB

  initdb

unix_socket_directories = '/home/teto/nova/jinko/core-platform-db'	# comma-separated list of directories

\conninfo

* how to force tcp/ip connection

  export PGHOST=localhost

createuser owning_user

sudo -u postgres psql 

As my own user:
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
 psql
 psql: error: FATAL:  role "teto" does not exist
 #+END_SRC

psql -U postgres -c 'SHOW config_file'

ps_isready -h hostname -U postgres is nice to test connection

+template1=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "template1" as user "teto" via socket in "/run/postgresql" at port "5432".

```
$ pg_tmp 
postgresql:///test?host=%2Ftmp%2Fephemeralpg.qG7Ya5
```

export POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION=postgres:///run/postgresql

* How to remove a DB

# Peer authentication failed for user "postgres"
https://gist.github.com/AtulKsol/4470d377b448e56468baef85af7fd614
Bottomline is `sudo -u postgres psql `
ALTER USER postgres with password ‘new-password’;
SHOW hba_file;

`sudo -u postgres createuser teto` worked
With additionnal permissions
sudo -u postgres createuser teto --createdb --echo -s
CREATE USER foo WITH PASSWORD 'secret';

# 
ALTER ROLE teto WITH SUPERUSER CREATEROLE CREATEDB;

# How to list the tables ?
`\l`
\dt core.*

# list users
`\du`

# how to switch databases ?
postgres=# \c sales

CREATE ROLE username superuser;

# \dt

* ISSUES

** `WARNING:  database "postgres" has a collation version mismatch`

collation refers to locales/glibc etc
```
template1=# show lc_collate;
 lc_collate  
-------------
 en_US.UTF-8
(1 row)
```

Dont forget to add the ";"
```
ALTER DATABASE template1 REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;
```

** FATAL:  database "postgres" does not exist

sudo -u postgres psql  -d template1
