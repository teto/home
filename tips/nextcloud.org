* what is nextcloud-occ ?

occ stands for "OwnCloud Client"


  occ = pkgs.writeScriptBin "nextcloud-occ" ''

https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html

If deployement fails with:
Next Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOException: SQLSTATE[42P01]: Undefined table: 7 ERROR: relation "oc_appconfig" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT * FROM "oc_appconfig"
one can try:
sudo rm /var/lib/nextcloud/config/config.php


* Username is invalid because files already exist for this user

This is such a bad message
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/nextcloud felt good
