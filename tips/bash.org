* How to deal with autocompletion ?

complete is a builtins. type it to list all candidates

             autoload -U bashcompinit
 
`help set` will show you options:
argbash -o {script_file} {script_file}

How to handle argbash-init ?

Just run argbash -o {script_file} {script_file} to update. But this is only needed if the template section (ie: the commented block starting with # Created by argbash-init v2.10.0) has been changed
